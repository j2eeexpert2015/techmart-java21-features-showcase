## ✨ **Java 21 Features Demonstrated**

### 🎯 **1. ✅ Sequenced Collections - Smart Shopping Cart**
**Business Problem**: Shopping cart with undo/redo and recently viewed products

**Traditional Approach**:
```java
// Manual first/last element access - verbose and error-prone
if (!cart.isEmpty()) {
    CartItem first = cart.iterator().next();
    CartItem last = null;
    for (CartItem item : cart) {
        last = item;
    }
}
```

**Java 21 Solution**:
```java
// Clean, intuitive sequenced operations
CartItem newest = cart.getLast();
CartItem oldest = cart.getFirst();
cart.addFirst(priorityItem);
cart.removeLast(); // Undo last action
```

**Business Value:**
- ✅ VIP customers get priority item placement with `addFirst()`
- ✅ Undo functionality using `removeLast()` - O(1) operation
- ✅ Recently viewed products with automatic LRU management
- ✅ Cart history with chronological ordering maintained

---

### 🎯 **2. ✅ Record Patterns - Smart Payment Processing**
**Business Problem**: Process different payment methods with complex business rules

**Traditional Approach**:
```java
if (payment instanceof CreditCard) {
    CreditCard cc = (CreditCard) payment;
    if (cc.isInternational() && cc.getAmount() > 1000) {
        // Handle international high-value transaction
        // Lots of casting and manual checks
    }
}
```

**Java 21 Solution**:
```java
PaymentProcessingResult result = switch (paymentMethod) {
    case CreditCard(var number, var type, var cvv, var month, var year, 
                   var name, var isInternational, var createdAt)
        when amount.compareTo(HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD) > 0 && isInternational -> {
        
        logger.info("High-value international transaction: {} {}", amount, type);
        yield PaymentProcessingResult.requiresVerification(
            paymentMethod, amount, "amount > $1000 && isInternational",
            "CreditCard", "High-value international transaction requires verification"
        );
    }
    
    case PayPal(var email, var accountId, var isVerified, var saveForFuture, var createdAt)
        when customer.isPremium() -> {
        
        logger.info("Premium customer PayPal: {} for {}", email, customer.tier());
        yield PaymentProcessingResult.expedited(
            paymentMethod, amount, "PayPal", customer.tier().toString(), discount
        );
    }
    
    case BankTransfer(var account, var routing, var bankName, 
                     var accountType, var holderName, var createdAt)
        when amount.compareTo(LARGE_TRANSFER_THRESHOLD) >= 0 -> {
        
        logger.info("Large bank transfer requires approval: {} from {}", amount, bankName);
        yield PaymentProcessingResult.requiresApproval(
            paymentMethod, amount, "amount >= $5000", "BankTransfer",
            "Large bank transfer requires manager approval"
        );
    }
    
    // More patterns... No default case needed - compiler enforces exhaustiveness!
};
```

**Business Value:**
- ✅ Type-safe payment method handling with sealed interfaces
- ✅ Complex business rules expressed clearly with guard conditions
- ✅ Automatic fraud detection based on amount + geography
- ✅ Customer tier-based processing (Premium gets expedited PayPal)
- ✅ No runtime ClassCastException - compiler verified
- ✅ Exhaustive pattern matching - can't forget a payment method
